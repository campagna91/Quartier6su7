# Quartier6su7

The Quartier 6/7 project is an academic initiative designed to showcase a group of YouTubers searching for new faces and talents. To achieve this, the group provides a service where new users are invited to express their own comedic idea (page 'POST AN IDEA'), which, upon approval by the administrator, can be featured among the published ideas. This allows for input from the audience in terms of comments suggesting improvements to the idea or other feedback.
